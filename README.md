# Sparse-Matrix-Calculator
A calculator developed for mathematical operations on Sparse matrices using C++

A Sparse matrix is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero. Mathematical operations using sparse matrices take up a lot of memory in computers if we cater for all the zeros in the matrix. Using techniques learned from OOP and Data structures, this calculator was developed to perform mathematical operations on sparse matrices using minimum amount of memory.

## Matrix Operations Implemented
The following mathematical operations have been implemented for this calculator:
* Addition
* Subtraction
* Scalar Multiplication
* Matrix Multiplication
* Transpose
* Determinant
* Row Echelon Form
* Reduced Row Echelon Form
* Rank of Matrix
* LU-Factorization

## Examples
Here are a few examples of some advanced operations using this calculator:
